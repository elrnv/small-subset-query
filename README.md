# small-subset-query
This project contains various implementations of solving the small subset query problem using inverted indexing.

I came across a problem during my work with 3D mesh repair that involved an
efficient solution to this problem, and I decided to build some tests to compare
the runtimes of each solution separately before commiting to the final solution.

I made a short talk about this repo and wrote the slides using [Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SdxUIAaNRQu7FR_n2c3zedvVcVVhcKmJ3-jXrcQYN40/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000). The details should be clear from the slides, including the formal problem definition and the motivation for solving it.
